# About Me
## My Interests
I do quite a few hobbies! Table top games, Magic: The Gathering, video games, reading, as well as exercise! I recently graduated with my Bachelors in Business Administration, and am hoping to increase my knoweldge when it comes to the more technical aspects of things. 
## Websites I Reccomend
- I highly reccomend first, [The Wayback Machine!](https://web.archive.org/) This is a website that allows you to search across the internet for specific web pages, at a different point in time. For example, you could look at Youtube during 2011! It is an incredible feat of archiving, of media and information that could otherwise be lost!
- I secondly reccomend [Geoguessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/). While this site does require a signup, it is an excellent game that lets you guess where you are on the planet, based on google street views that it gives you.
